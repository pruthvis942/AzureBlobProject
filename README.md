Welcome to my Dotnet MVC Application with Azure Blob Storage Integration project! This repository demonstrates the integration of Azure Blob Storage with a Dotnet 6 application, offering practical insights into managing blobs and containers.


## Overview

This MVC project demonstrates the integration of Azure Blob Storage with a Dotnet 6 application, following the MVC architecture and employing the repository design pattern. 


## Tech Stack Used

**Azure Blob Storage:** Primary storage solution for scalable and secure data storage.

**Dotnet 6:** Leveraging C#, ASP.NET Core MVC, Entity Framework Core, and Azure Storage SDK for Dotnet.

**MVC Architecture:** Organized into Model, View, and Controller components.

**Repository Design Pattern:** A structured approach for managing data access and abstraction.
## Features

    Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on blobs.
    List all blobs in a container.
- Container Operations:
    Create, Delete, and List containers.
- Metadata Handling:
